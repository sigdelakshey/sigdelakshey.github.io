As my leisure pursuits, I immerse myself in movies, animes, and documentaries. While I typically gravitate towards non-fiction reading, I find joy in crafting fiction stories of my own. Beyond the realm of creative expression, I seek thrills through rock climbing and hiking, embracing the adrenaline rush these exhilarating sports provide.
