*This project is the one I worked on for my Undergraduate Minor Project. We developed a Flutter based mobile application that facilitates finding rooms and apartments for rent near any local. We had it distributed among more than 250 incoming freshers in ERC, Dharan for their ease to find rooms near campus area.*
