*Love being one of the biochemical idiosyncrasy bestowed upon by evolutionary biology that us all experience to be sublime sense of serenity is a mere nothing more than with the **higher goal of planting the seeds** but could there be?.., there is a much better way to it but that’s for another topic.*

Love, for ages has been projected in terms of romanticism in Folklores, Books, Songs, Movies, etc. Romanticism do bring in the buck$ and So the Way of Loving, for ages that’s what is being tweaked over every few years or so, to fit the generational drift.
As Society has fully opted Digitalization in there lives, and is slowly heading its way towards **Uncultured Domain of Self** and how sex being viewed as a play-game even for kiddie-wink; the question now arise, where does Love find it’s place in all this?
Love, now being viewed as co-dependency and with social media expanding our out-reach to people its fair to say that Dates are now more of a thing of whom we can share our finances and status with rather then someone to feel a connection and to live with forever in all highs and lows. As culture progresses, we will witness a state of being that I would describe as “Self-Deprived”, the state of being so self consumed with own happiness forgetting that game runs with social strings attached. It not always, just about us and our own peace when we out there in war with the world.

Self-Love is a hot-trend this decades. #Self-Love, #Self-Care, etc.. quite a trend on Social platforms I see…but it sort of seems to have being confused with it’s premise, as many a men I see are more of self-centered in name of self-love. Self-Love, in my opinion is more of self-discipline than whatever non-sensical stuff we do over the internet…yep! I’m kind of guilty of that as well.
Romanticism in a way has now lost it’s touch with us…we as a generation think it’s thing of a child-play now. But since the market for love exist and will always in a way, it’s now of question What? & How? will it replace romanticism and to what degree the change happen.
Love has already been digitized in several ways, with a plethora of dating apps, and this has altered our perceptions of love, intimacy, and connection. We are more focused on texting than face-to-face meetups, use more emoticons to express our emotions, and don’t forget about those cheesy, if not cringy, pickup lines from the internet to get the ball rolling. Because girls now have a wider range of options and most boys try out several girls at once using the same old techniques, the pattern of conversation has become somewhat repetitive.
**According to veteran relationship counselor Gary Chapman, there are five universal love languages**: words of encouragement, acts of service, gifts, quality time, and physical contact. And this can be much more difficult. And, considering the prominent role of technology in modern romance, this may be an even more difficult challenge. Do well-written texts count as “words of affirmation”? Is face-time with your partner considered “quality time”? What has changed in your own romantic language in the modern age?

## 1. WORDS OF AFFIRMATION
>If the partner’s primary love language is words of encouragement, kind words of appreciation, gratitude, and respect will deeply sink in.
>Sending texts to check in with your partner throughout the day is okay, but make it a point to call them to say “I love you” or “I’m thinking about you.” You may think you are too busy, but every single person has the time to make a 30-second phone call to the one that they love. Texts should be limited to logistics or additional words of praise and affirmation.

## 2. ACTS OF SERVICE
>If acts of service are your partner’s primary love language, then deeds, not words, will be most appreciated.
>Actions speak louder than words if this is your partner’s main love language. Cooking a meal for your husband, picking up his dry cleaning, giving her a massage, folding the laundry, and caring for your partner while he or she is sick are all services that people appreciate.
>And technology really helps with a lot of this. How? Looking for instant stress relief? There’s an app that makes scheduling a massage at your home a 30-second operation. Do you have a hunger strike in the middle of the night? With tens of thousands of restaurants in its database, there’s an app that delivers food 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Are you fed up with wasting so much money on groceries? There’s an app that helps you compare prices of similar products at various stores. On-demand apps do help to save time and money.

## 3. RECEIVING GIFTS
>If your partner’s primary love language is receiving gifts, then tokens of affection are taken as a symbol of love.
Gifts for birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries will, of course, make your partner feel special and adored. However, you can go above and beyond by offering a gift on “no reason” days. It doesn’t have to expensive stuff, for them it’s the thoughts that counts.

## 4. QUALITY TIME
>If your partner’s primary love language is quality time, then giving him or her your undivided, undistracted attention is what matters most.
>Some of us take pride in our multitasking abilities, but if quality time is your partner’s love language, spreading yourself too thin won’t help your relationship develop. You must learn to give your partner your undivided attention and to bond intimately with your partner. And this is the only way he or she can feel truly loved.

## 5. PHYSICAL TOUCH
>If your partner’s primary love language is physical touch, reaching out and touching your partner communicates a deep love.
>Touching your partner, whether it’s with a squeeze of the side, a tight hug, or even an intimate bedroom encounter, is extremely significant. Make a deliberate effort to thoughtfully touch your partner. With a hug and kiss, you can start and finish your day. Give a massage to your girlfriend. Keep their hand or saddle up close instead of sitting quietly next to them.

In conclusion, individuals instinctively offer and show affection in the manner in which they prefer to be loved. They should, however, be using the love languages that their partners will understand. To Love in this day-and-age, where we many of option to choose from and go after, we should prefer to choose one that best fits the way we want to be loved and the way we can love.

However, the core problem remains the same: we must all make a deliberate effort to understand how our spouses perceive and experience love in order to empathize and interact more effectively. And we must recognize that technology, in its current state, can be both a help and a hindrance in terms of expressing and experiencing love.
