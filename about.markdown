## Research Interests

I am interested in **Machine Learning**, particularly **Computer Vision** but also **Natural Language Processing**. I aim to leverage Machine Learning techniques for social good applications that can have wide societal impact. Following is a list of areas that I have conducted research on or would like to work on in the near future:

- **Visual Scene Understanding:** Developing computer vision algorithms to make a computer understand visual scenes. Sources for such scenes can be (but not limited to) photograph, videos, satellite imagery, medical images, etc.  

- **Moving Object Detection and Tracking:** Enabling a machine to accurately identify moving objects like vehicles in a road and track their movement.

- **AI for Social Good:** Developing Machine Learning powered applications with primary goal of improving humanitarian efforts. Example scenarios include crisis response, urban planning, clean energy, etc. 

- **NLP for low resource languages:** Exploring transfer learning and self supervised learning in NLP to bridge the resource gap for low resource languages like Nepali. 

- **Multimodal Deep Learning:** Integrating multiple sources of information like language and vision in a single learning task.

If you'd like to collaborate in any of the above, feel free to [reach out](/contact.md) to me.

## Notable Projects

- **Disaster Impact Assessment from Satellite Imagery** — *Undergraduate Thesis* (**Ongoing**)

A research project that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques like semantic segmentation and image classification to identify the regions in satellite images that are affected by natural disasters like floods.

- **Room Finder Application** ​ — ​ *Undergraduate Minor Project*

A Flutter based mobile application that allows for finding avail rooms and apartment for rent near any local. The completed application which was distributed among incoming freshers in ERC, Dharan for their ease to find rooms near campus area, was taken warmly with high appreciation and positive feedback.

- [**Traffic Monitoring Platform** ​ — ​ *KU HackFest*](/technical writing/traffic-map)

A Computer Vision based software to classify and count the total number of Nepali vehicles in the road and estimate the road occupancy. This project uses Nepali Vechile Dataset for training object detection model that was created duely by our brothers at pulchowk.
